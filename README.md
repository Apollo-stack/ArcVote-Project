# 🗳️ ArcVote - Decentralized Voting System

**ArcVote** is a dApp (Decentralized Application) built on the **Arc Network Testnet**.
It allows users to cast votes for their favorite assets in a transparent, immutable, and spam-resistant way.

## 🚀 Live Demo
- **DApp URL:** https://apollo-stack.github.io/ArcVote-Project/
- **Verified Contract:** https://testnet.arcscan.app/address/0x50b9eD83D4d0e36157042feb71Fc8ECe3dD55422

## 🛠️ Features
- **Smart Contract Logic:** Custom Solidity contract deployed on Arc Testnet.
- **Spam Prevention:** Users can only vote once per wallet address.
- **Real-time Updates:** Front-end listens to blockchain state to update scores instantly.
- **Circle Ecosystem:** Native integration with Arc Testnet using USDC as Gas.

## 💻 Tech Stack
- **Blockchain:** Arc Network (Testnet)
- **Language:** Solidity (v0.8.19)
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Ethers.js
- **Tools:** Remix IDE, MetaMask

## 📦 How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/SEU_USUARIO/ArcVote-Project.git](https://github.com/SEU_USUARIO/ArcVote-Project.git)
   
2. Open the folder and start a local server (using Python):
   ```bash
   python -m http.server
   
3. Access http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

## 🔜 Future Roadmap
This is the V1 of the project. I am currently studying the documentation to implement:

[ ] USDC Payments: Allow users to donate USDC to the project.

[ ] Dynamic Candidates: Admin dashboard to add new tokens.
